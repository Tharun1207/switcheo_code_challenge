Inefficiencies:

 1. Missing parameters
  - 'blockchain' parameter is used in the 'getPriority' function call in the definition of 'sortedBalances' function,
    but it's not declared in WalletBalance interface.
  - 'usdValue' is added later into the code, in the rows variable, but it can be done during the sorting and formatting
    stage, and also storing it as an attribute for FormattedWalletBalance interface, as it is essentially a formatting 
    technique. 

 2. Repetition of interface instead of extension
  - FormattedWalletBalance interface includes the attributes in the WalletBalance interface, but adds a few more attributes, 
    making it a sub interface.
  - Extension hence makes sense here to avoid this repetition.

 3. Unnecessary destructuring and extension of props when they are unused 
  - 'children' and '..rest' variables are destructured from 'props' but never used in the component, hence being unnecessary and can be removed.
  - Unnecessary extenstion of BoxProps to implement Props 

 4. Inefficiencies in error handling
  - Error handling in 'useEffect' block in WalletPage component can be improved using a try-catch block
  - This ensures robustness and gracefulness when handling errors

 5. Lack of concise logic
  - 'Zilliqa' and 'Neo' results in the same return statement, which results in redundancy and unclean code
  - Sorting logic returns the difference of rightPriority and leftPriority, which removes the unnecessary 'else' case
    and hence cleaner and efficient code

 6. Separate formatting
  - Creates an additional loop for the formatting of the wallet balances provided, causing unnecessary overhead
  - Solved by formatting them right after the sort, eliminating the additional loop and unnecessary overhead
