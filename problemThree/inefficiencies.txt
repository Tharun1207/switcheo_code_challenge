Inefficiencies:

1. 'children' and '..rest' variables are destructured frim 'props' but never used in the component, hence being unnecessary and can be removed.

 2. 'lhsPriority' and 'leftPriority' are used inconsistently within the sorting function, leading to confusion on the reader's part.

 3. Multiple sorting:
 - 'sortedBalances' array is being sorted multiple times. 
 - First, it is filtered, which is a sort in itself. Then, it is sorted based on priorities. 
 - This can lead to inefficiency in large arrays

 4. 'useWalletbalances' and 'usePrices' functions are called without memoization, which can lead to unnecessary computational overhead when performing
 expensive calculations or fetching data repeatedly.

 5. 'Zilliqa' and 'Neo' results in the same return statement, which results in redundancy and unclean code

 6. 'getPriority' function takes 'blockchain' as an argument with type 'any', which can be improved by giving it a type.


 The refactored code implementation is in temp-app folder, where refactored.tsx has the refactored code.
